# String_Art
Made a library class that performs calculations for string connections between nails to let the underlying result resemble an image.
It can also print a continuous list of connection points, so anyone in real life can use only one piece of long string, and make connections along nails to make the string art.

## Some Examples

#### Stormtrooper helmet, n = 151 points, ~2000 strings
