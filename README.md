Made a library class that performs calculations for string connections between nails to let the underlying result resemble an image.
It can also print a continuous list of connection points, so anyone in real life can use only one piece of long string, and make connections along nails to make the string art.

## Some Examples

#### Stormtrooper helmet

This is a stormtrooper helmet, done using n = 151 points on the circle and around 3000 strings between them. (But it can be done in much lesser than 3000 strings as well.)

#### Lamborghini Aventador
